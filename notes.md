These are running notes for the website. There are a great deal of things that need to be done before I've got anything that I'm happy with showing to the outside world. There are a lot of files right now, not sure that every one is functional or relevant.

That being said, right now the majority of the work is with file clean-up. As such, there should be an -old suffix for a lot of the current files that will have a lot of the commented out code that never ends up getting used (but is instructive nonetheless). Also, I am happy with the landingPage (index.html or isaranwrap.github.io) and I should work on creating a similar landing Page for everything thereafter. The first should be the easiest - with selecting one of two: (1) LEARN A LANGUAGE and (2) LEARN CHESS.

Then after, it can get more complicated as the tree grows but the initial foray would be something quite simple and linear.
